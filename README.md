Kuroki is built with Fastify and Vue.js (with Vite and TailwindCSS in JIT mode). Frontend is deployed to the Cloudflare global content delivery network. Backend requests are handled by a bare-metal K3s cluster running on Hetzner Cloud, managed in GitOps way by FluxCD, on volatile infrastructure provisioned by Ansible.
